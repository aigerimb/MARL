# Multi-agent-RL-Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of multi-agent reinforcment learning algorithms:

## MADDPG 
To run the algorithm please install  [Multi-agent Particle Environment](https://github.com/openai/multiagent-particle-envs) (MPE). During installation you may encounter some bugs related to the older version of gyn used for implementing MPE. Please refer to this tutorial on how to fix [installation errors](https://medium.com/@amulyareddyk97/openais-multi-agent-particle-environments-515bea61c3ad).
